# Advent of Code 2022: Solutions

## Answers to advent of code problems 2022, completed in mutiple languages => C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript

### Understanding The Solutions

If at any point you get stuck understanding the solutions, you can find a breakdown of the steps in the day's associated Python file.

This is because I do the problems in python first, then translate them to the other languages.

If there is ever a discrepency in solutions between languages, there will be an associated unique description in that language's file.
